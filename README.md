# Live Demo
Try out the live demo at http://demo.hoosk.org

# Uploading Hoosk

This is simple to do, theres no need to open any config files in an editor or anything like that!

Once downloaded just unzip and upload everything to the web root folder (public_html, web, www, different servers name this folder differently but its generally one of those)

# Installing Hoosk

Once the upload is finished just navigate your browser to http://yourwebsite.com/install
Here you will be presented with the form which will create your config file.
This needs your website name, address, and database details.

When entering your website address make sure not to include the "http://" or the trailing slash "/"
for example:

If my website is "http://hoosk.org" then I would only enter "hoosk.org"

When you have entered these click install, and thats it, simple!

Be sure and delete the "/install" directory from your server now
